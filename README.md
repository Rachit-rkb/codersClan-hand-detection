# CodersClan Task#994 - Hand Detection

The task of hand detection was submitted from *DanSaloman* to be done in either
C++ or Java. With that said, NodeJS was also done and can also be submitted as
a solution.

The NodeJS files currently exist in *javascript* directory and as well, you can
run the wrapper index.js file to test it with a picture.
